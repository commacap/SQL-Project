## Background  
In today's competitive job market, understanding the relationship between skills, salary, and demand is crucial for career growth. This project was guided by [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](lukebarousse.com/sql). It focuses on identifying patterns in job postings for **Data Analysts** from 2023 by analyzing salary trends and required skills, particularly for remote opportunities.  

The primary objectives include:
1. Discovering the highest-paying Data Analyst roles.
2. Identifying skills that drive higher salaries.
3. Finding in-demand skills to prioritize for learning.

## Tools I Used  
The following tools and technologies were used to perform the analysis:
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing job market data from relational databases.
- **PostgreSQL:** My choice of database management system. Ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Git and GitHub**: To control versions of my SQL scripts and allow for sharing.
- **Database structure**:
  - `job_postings_fact`: Contains job-related data such as job IDs, titles, salaries, and locations.
  - `company_dim`: Provides information about hiring companies.
  - `skills_job_dim`: Links jobs to required skills.
  - `skills_dim`: Stores details about individual skills.

## The Analysis  
The project is divided into five stages, each addressing a specific question through SQL queries:
1. **Top-Paying Jobs**  
   Identify the top 10 remote Data Analyst roles with specific salary information (`NOT NULL`).  
   *Key Metrics:* Job titles, hiring companies, locations, and average yearly salaries.  
   *File:* `1_top_paying_jobs.sql`
      ```sql
      SELECT
